## Implementation Order Summary

1. **Phase 1**: Core infrastructure (library loading, registration)
2. **Phase 2**: Game execution engine (core game running logic)
3. **Phase 3**: Multithreading implementation (performance)
4. **Phase 4**: Result processing and output (required functionality)
5. **Phase 5**: Advanced features (robustness and optimization)
6. **Phase 6**: Testing and validation (quality assurance)

## Critical Path Dependencies

- **Phase 1** must be completed before Phase 2
- **Phase 2** must be completed before Phase 4
- **Phase 3** can be developed in parallel with Phase 2
- **Phase 5** depends on all previous phases
- **Phase 6** should be done throughout development

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Simulator can load GameManager and Algorithm libraries
- [ ] Simulator can execute games in both modes
- [ ] Results are properly formatted and written to files
- [ ] Multithreading works correctly with configurable thread count
- [ ] Error handling is robust and informative
- [ ] All assignment requirements are met

## Notes

- Focus on Phase 1-4 first to meet basic assignment requirements
- Phase 5-6 can be implemented after core functionality is working
- Test each phase thoroughly before moving to the next
- Keep the existing shell structure intact while filling in the implementation details
